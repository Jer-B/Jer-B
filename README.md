### üëã Hi there!

This Github is a secondary account centralized around my portfolio. (Maybe switch it as principal account over time)
I'm a passionate developer constantly exploring the realms of technology and innovation. My areas of keen interest include:

- **Blockchain**
- **Web Development**
- **Experiments**
- ***And everything i come across that i like*

I'm always in the process of **updating**, **learning**, and **creating**, experimenting with things.

### üöß Portfolio Update - 2024

As of the **Q1 of 2024**, I'm deeply immersed in refining my portfolio, for a new job. My goal is to not only showcase my skills but also my dedication to growth and excellence in technology. While some of my projects are **"Work in progress,"** I believe in transparency and sharing both the challenges and successes.
I need some times to update, readapt and upload past and currents projects.

### ü§ù Let's Connect

Feel free to explore my repositories. I'm open to connecting, building, sharing, and innovating together. Let's make something great!
