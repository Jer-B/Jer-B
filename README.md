### 👋 Hi there!

My portfolio:
🇯🇵 [Japanese・日本語版](https://jer-b.github.io/portofolio.html)
🇬🇧 [English Ver.](https://jer-b.github.io/portfolio_en.html)
🇫🇷 [Ver. Français](https://jer-b.github.io/portfolio_fr.html)

This Github is a secondary account centered around my portfolio. (Maybe will switch it as principal account over time)
I'm a passionate developer constantly exploring the realms of technology and innovation. My areas of keen interest include:

- **Blockchain** | **Web Development** | **Experiments** | ***And everything I come across that I like or want to try*

I'm always in the process of **updating**, **learning**, and **creating**, experimenting with things.

### 🚧 Portfolio Update - 2024

As of the **Q1 of 2024**, I'm deeply immersed in refining my portfolio, for a new job. My goal is to not only showcase my skills but also my dedication to growth. While some of my projects are **"Work in progress,"** I believe in transparency and sharing both the challenges and successes.
- I need some time to update, readapt, and upload past and current projects.

### 🤝 Let's Connect

Feel free to explore my repositories, and to contact me on the platform where you encountered my profile. 📫
